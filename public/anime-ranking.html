<h1>The Best Animated Shows According to Brice</h1>
<h2>My top 3 shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dragonball</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the messages, the fighting and the art.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Bizarre anime that has grips you by the retinas</p>
<h3>Archer</h3>
<p>Ridiculously quotable intellectual humor that stood the time.</p>
